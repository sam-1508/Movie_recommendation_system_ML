The algorithm used here is **SVD - Singular Value Decomposition**

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a powerful technique in linear algebra that can help you perform various tasks in machine learning, such as dimensionality reduction, data compression, noise reduction, feature extraction, and latent factor analysis commonly used in recommendation systems. The Surprise library's SVD class implements the SVD algorithm for collaborative filtering.
